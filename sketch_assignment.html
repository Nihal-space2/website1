    <h1>Understanding Generative AI</h1>
    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>1. What Is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models designed to generate new content, whether it be written, visual, audio, or other media types, based on patterns learned from training on pre-existing data. Trained on data available until October 2023, it uses deep learning machine learning algorithms to analyze human-like patterns and structures in huge data sets and can later generate more data automatically.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Key Elements of Generative AI</h2>
        <p>Gen AI often uses deep neural networks like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn and create content.</p>
        <p><strong>Training Data:</strong> Large datasets are needed to train these models. For instance, a model could be trained on vast amounts of written text to generate text.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Types of Generative AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text Generation:</strong> Models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) from OpenAI can generate coherent and contextually appropriate text given a prompt.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Generation:</strong> GANs are frequently employed to generate realistic images including faces, scenery, and abstract art.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Working Mechanisms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Phase:</strong> The AI model learns the intrinsic patterns and features from the data fed into it during training. For instance, a text generation model can learn aspects such as syntax, semantics, and even writing style, from a corpus of text.</li>
            <li><strong>Generation Stage:</strong> Post training, the model uses the information it has learned to generate new output.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Use Cases of Generative AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creative Industries:</strong> Used to inspire and generate new forms of art, music, and literature.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Generation:</strong> Automated content generation for marketing, journalism, and entertainment.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Simulation & Training:</strong> Synthetic data is generated hyper-realistically for training of some other AI models or to practically simulate environments.</li>
        </ul>
